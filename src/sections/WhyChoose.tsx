          Carbon offsetting funds solutions to reducing carbon emissions now.
          Frequently carbon offsetting reduces emissions much faster than you
          can as an individual/single company. Carbon offsetting projects help
          to combat global climate change as well as caring for local
          communities. In many instances providing much needed employment,
          health improvement, biodiversity, reforestation and broad social
          benefits to impoverished communities.
